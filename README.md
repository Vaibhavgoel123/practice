This is the practice repo where I learn GitHub
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your name"
git config --global user.email "Your email"
```
These commands can be used to associate your username and email with the repository
```bash
git config --global core.editor  "code --wait"
# For setting up vscode as deafult editor
```
Cofiguration Levels
1. ```System (all users)```
2. ```Global (current user)```
3. ```Local (current repo)```
